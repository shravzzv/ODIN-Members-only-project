# Members Only

[Project demo](https://)

## Description

An exclusive clubhouse where members can write anonymous posts. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is, but outside they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

This was an assignment from The Odin Project. See the [Project Source](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-members-only) for more details.

## Features

- **Anonymous Posting**: Share your thoughts and stories without revealing your identity to the public.
- **Member-Visible Attribution**: Within the clubhouse, members can see the author's name and post creation time for each message.
- **Selective Membership**: Gain access to the full member experience with the secret passcode.
- **Secure Login**: Ensure your account's safety with robust login procedures powered by **Passport.js**.
- **Optional Admin Functionality**: Grant designated users the ability to delete messages, maintaining order within the clubhouse (optional feature).
- **Responsive Design**: The application is built for all devices.
